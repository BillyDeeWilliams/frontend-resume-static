# frontend-resume-static
a hard coded two column prettified modern resume using CSS. My goal is to create a document that better communicates my experience and skill-set better than the current reume document I have, which is basically an attempt to approach the problem int he same way I have in the past for retail or service industry roles. Recent conversations with recruiters has led me to the conclusion that my current resume does not emphasize my proficiency with relevant technologies like react and node. This new resume model will focus on a modern and easily interpreted layout that is designed from the ground up to describe and highlight my experience and any projects/products i have created with node.js and React. Eventually I would like to build an app which creates resumes with some input options for tailoring to specific positions.
